Today's research, along with the wider variety of emotionally complex games available, suggests that the future of gaming is closely linked to mental health and wellness. In 2015, a [study](https://www.mountainlaurelsudbury.org/blog/archives/02-2015.html) showed that playing video games can improve cognitive abilities, while other research found that regular gaming can enhance emotional intelligence and help manage stress and negative emotions. A 2022 study also indicated that playing video games as a family can have similar mental health benefits, helping families deal with stress. Additionally, a [2021 report](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34132648/) suggested that gaming can alleviate depression, improve social interactions, and reduce feelings of isolation. This shows that gaming can provide structure, agency, and control, which can be particularly beneficial for those dealing with mental health issues. With the old stigma of video games being harmful to mental health fading away, it's clear that gaming can actually have positive effects on mental well-being.
